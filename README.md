##Module 4 Lab 2 - Templates

###Exercise 1 :
Modify the addCard function from the previous slide
so that you can pass content for the card dynamically.

###Exercise 2 :
Call addCard repeatedly so that your cards are
automatically generated based on data from an array.
This way you will create as many cards as you need to
display all the data in the array.

###Exercise 3 - the artistâ€™s portfolio:
Populate the page dynamically, by generating an artist
profile card which includes cards representing the
items in an artist's portfolio. Extension: make an array
of artists, all with multiple portfolio items.
